In this project I tried making a simple menu for a Haunted Island themed game.

I remember being really excited when I got the program's mouse to change when hovering a menu item.

The audio doesn't seem to be used, but I had planned to make one soundtrack for each area of the island,
and had a lot of fun on an old organ :)


# Old Audio Format

The audio files here are DVI ADPCM. They will not play on most audio players. Audacity seems to work.
