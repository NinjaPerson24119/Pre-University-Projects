A special mission readme file.

GETTING STARTED:

At the start of the game it will ask you questions. Press any button to goto the next question then eventually a button will appear needle it.(im just having fun with the expresion neddle it because your mouse is a needle.) It know will change screens to the start screen. Press any key then left click to continue to the mainmenu.(Note that you can not move your needle until you press a button.) Now you are at the mainmenu. You will notice text on the left side of the screen. This tells you the asess codes to exit,view your status,view the help and the code for MISSION 1. These codes are used only at certain times. You will also notice there is either a number or a letter seperated from the word beside it by a dash. This means you must press that number or letter on the keyboard to goto the area seperated from that number or letter by a dash.

MISSIONS:

MISSIONS are the levels that you complete by clicking the button in that mission or doing what the button tells you to do. But take note to your gut feeling for the button will try to trick you into doing things from end tasking everything to
restarting your computer but it's really you that did that not the game. There is no such thing as "FAILING" your level that's an abbreviation of rebooting,exiting or endtasking prettymuch...However you lucky duck there is such thing as winning a level...you just have to follow your gut feeling,use knoledge and sometimes do what the button tells you to do or tells you not to do. At the end of each level you will be given a letter and a number to the next mission. The letter is a piece of the code to the secret button levels and the letters from the secret button levels are pieces of the code to the three minigames that arn't button games...sadly...read more lower in this readme under BONUSES:! Remember the codes for levels and the numbers are all kept in your Status. (SEE STATUS REPORT.)

BONUSES:

Bonuses are unlocked by unscrambling the letters in your STATUS to make a word that can be used instead of the code to the STATUS area but you just type it were you would type the code to reach the STATUS area. The first password is twentysix letters long but the second that you get is five letters long and im not even helping you with the fourth...

STATUS REPORT:

In the mainmenu there is a status area that records your skill levels for your hammer ,needle and yes your cheesebun...I got bored...But the good thing is that the higher the skill the better the adventure otherwise known as play different missions with different skill levels to get a better laugh!
It also tells you what the assess codes are for the levels that you have passed and the first one you haven't!
It also mentions the bonus codes and it tells you the names of most of the bonuses...and will help you get bonuses if you have the right stuff!
