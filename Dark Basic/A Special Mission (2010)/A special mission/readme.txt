A special mission readme file.

GETTING STARTED:

At the start of the game it will ask you questions. Press any button to go to the next question then eventually a button will appear needle it.(im just having fun with the expresion needle it because your mouse is a needle.) It know will change screens to the start screen. Press any key then left click to continue to the mainmenu.(Note that you can not move your needle until you press a button.) Now you are at the mainmenu. You will notice text on the left side of the screen. This tells you the access codes to exit,view your status,view the help and the code for MISSION 1. These codes are used only at certain times. You will also notice there is either a number or a letter seperated from the word beside it by a dash. This means you must press that number or letter on the keyboard to go to the area seperated from that number or letter by a dash.

MISSIONS:

MISSIONS are the levels that you complete by clicking the button in that mission or doing what the button tells you to do. But take note to your gut feeling for the button will try to trick you into doing things from end tasking everything, to re-starting your computer but it's really you that did that not the game. There is no such thing as "FAILING" your level that's an abbreviation of rebooting,exiting or endtasking prettymuch...However you lucky duck, there is such things as winning a level...you just have to follow your gut feeling,use smarts and sometimes do what the button tells you to do or tells you not to do. At the end of each level you will be given a letter and a number to the next mission. The letter is a piece of the code to the secret button levels and the letters from the secret button levels are pieces of the code to the five minigames that arn't button games...sadly...read more lower in this readme under BONUSES:!Also in a mission you can change your weapon to a cheesebun a hammer and a needle.(How to do this is listed in CONTROLS:)
To continue at the end of a level wich is when the button speech is blank press escape!

BONUSES:

Bonuses are unlocked by typing the passletters in the order you got them to make a word or sentence that can be used instead of the code to the HELP area but you just type it were you would type the code to reach the HELP area. The first password is twentysix letters long, but the second is five letters long and i'm not even helping you with the fourth...
