A Special Mission help file

A Special Mission is very easy to play.
At the start the game will ask you questions then a button will appear. Click it. Then the title menu will appear press any button then press the left mouse button to reach the mainmenu. In the mainmenu some text will tell you the codes to start the game from mission 1 and also the codes to see your Game Progress
(STATUS) and to exit and to reach this help file. To select something simply press the first letter or number before each option then type the asess code. Every code is a six digit code exept for the codes listed in the text that I just mentioned. Each mission has a button you must press to figure out what to do. But sometimes there will be a button combination or something that you are supposed to press but really you must click the button or else you fail the mission. A Special Mission is a skill testing game that will try to catch you off guard. Sometimes the buttons can actually be funny though. If you fail the mission you will either exit the game or return to the mainmenu. However if you complete the mission you will be given the code for the next mission and that code also will be kept safe in the game status area of the mainmenu and will never be removed unless you follow the easy steps marked at the bottom of this help file. Each mission has a different button and if you manage to beat the game you will gain a few things that you will notice in the game status area of the mainmenu. I hope you like this game!

Deleting saved progress:
Look for a file saved in the folder that this games resources are for a file called "savefiles" open it and backspace every single thing in it then when you exit and it say's "do you wish to save" click yes and there you go the save data is erased but do not play with anything else in this folder because it can wreck the game and follow exactly what is said here or the savefile function will be damaged.
