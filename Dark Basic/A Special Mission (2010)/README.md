A Special Mission was one of the last things I wrote in DarkBasic Classic

## Saving

Since there's no save state, at the end of each level, you get a code you can type in to start the next one.
So you'd need to have a paper handy to progress.

Each level involves a button that you push / attack with a cursor that can change between a needle, a hammer, or a cheese bun

## Gameplay

The button's job is to keep the next level's code safe.

If you hit it 25 times, it eventually stops complaining and gives you the code.

Pardon 10yo me's sense of humor lol.

## Scaling Up

You'll notice the horrible design and variable names.
At this time I had learned enough about programming to want to scale, but didn't understand that I couldn't just increase the line count.
I dropped coding for a bit until I got smart enough to learn C++ and increase complexity beyond simple things like
- loading and displaying images
- printing text
- and logic more complex than GOTO

You'll notice I tried to add some common components to lots of games at the time
- A main game
- A level editor
- An installer

I was very much trying to copy the experience of what I thought a "real game" was at the time.
