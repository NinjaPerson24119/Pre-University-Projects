"Canon Protector" is supposed to be a simple game where
1. The player is briefed about a war with some intense music
2. They jump straight in with a castle to shoot at. The player clicks to shoot at enemies on the castle in a classic shooting gallery game.
3. Either the player wins by getting all the targets, or they take too long and die.
