# Pre-University-Projects

Projects I made before university (2010-2017)

Some languages I spent time learning included
- C#
- DarkBasic (classic)
- C++

I also developed some stuff in GameMaker, but I don't think I have the files for those anymore.

## Motivation

It's been a really long time and I wanted to see what files I still had, and go down memory lane.

To have a catalog of games I've been writing since I was 10 years old is really incredible.

Some of it is downright embarassing :) but I love having it around anyway.

## Brief Timeline
- <2010 - GameMaker
- 2010-2011 DarkBasic (classic)
- 2013-2015 C++
- 2014-2017 C# (only wrote a few projects here)

## Running on wine
```
# get mono
winetricks --force dotnet40

winetricks vcrun2010
```

Debug binaries might not run at all since they target debug DLLs. These are not provided with wine.

## Framerate

Many of these were developed under the assumption of a slower machine, so may not be playable due to a fast framerate.

## DLLs

Some of these require DLLs that I chose not to redistribute.

Generally these are some subset of:
- DevIL.dll
- freeglut.dll
- ILU.dll
- ILUT.dll 

## Controls

May not work since some of these programs used questionable scan codes for mapping keys.
