This is a library I had progressively developed for my game ideas.

I was trying to solve a lot of problems I didn't actually have.
But as a result of building this, I learned a ton.
I think I was fascinated with the intricacies of the C++ STL and the existence of other libraries like the EA STL library meant to address inefficiencies.
I even tried to write my own allocators to avoid using new.
